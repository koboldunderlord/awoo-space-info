<h2>What is Awoo.space?</h2>

<p>Awoo.space is a small social network where folks are expected to be respectful of boundaries, and federates using a whitelist to make a better guarantee of this.

While Mastodon gives us a great many tools for helping people carve out safe spaces, it is more open than what more folks want out of an instance- federation is a concept that is difficult to explain, and some people  simply want to just use and speak with people on Mastodon.social, and nowhere else.

It is built and maintained by its admins and moderators to help curate a space where folks can be more open with another without worrying that they have to provide emotional labor if the discussion takes a turn for the worse.

<p>Moderators here take on a different role than other places- they do not have the power to directly silence or ban your account, and are instead are volunteers whom the administration trusts with a direct line of commmunication with the admin to help facilitate the respect of boundaries and keep discussion and education civil so that awoo.space is a safe place for folks.</p>

<p>We are interested in more moderators, but are not currently actively searching for new ones.  If you are interested, please contact the administrator.  We are trying to build a diverse team for this place and if you feel you fit into that and don't mind volunteering then please let us know!</p>
