<h2>What is Awoo.space?</h2>

<p>Awoo.space is a small social network where folks are expected to be respectful of boundaries and identities.  We have a dedicated team of moderators available to help deescalate conflict and help educate folks on social missteps if they inadvertantly cause harm.</p>

<p>While the Mastodon platform gives its users a great many tools that help to deal with abuse, the nature of federation can expose our users to admins and users on distant instances completely out of their control.  To mitigate this possible problem, awoo.space uses a server whitelist to selectively federate with other instances in order to more sustainably grow the network and limit exposure to potential harassment and abuse.</p>

<p>Our vision is to curate a space where folks can be more open with one another while still being able to control their public visibility without being forced to provide emotional labor when folks accidentally step across boundaries.</p>

<p>If things sound too locked down here for you, there are plenty of other great instances you can find from our <a href=#whitelist>whitelist below</a> or searching for an instance using <a>instances.mastodon.xyz</a>.</p>

<h2>I'm an instance admin.  How do I federate with awoo.space?</h2>

<p>We think of Awoo.space as a well-run house party, with other instances as the invitees. We need to trust the folks we let into our party, and we need to know they won't bring along anyone else who will make the party suck for everyone. This is especially a concern given how admins can't always account for the actions of all their users, much less users of other instances they federate with.</p>

<p>With that in mind, here's what we look for when deciding whether or not to federate with other instances:</p> 

<ul>
  <li>Your instance has a CoC similar to Mastodon.social's, or you agree with Mastodon.social's CoC and follow its principles while administrating your instance</li>
  <li>You understand that your users are subject to awoo.space's CoC while interacting with our users</li>
  <li>You're not federating with instances whose administration has a history of ignoring or encouraging abuse of Mastodon users on their platform. The instances we're currently particularly concerned about are:
    <ul>
      <li>shitposter.club</li>
      <li>sealion.club</li>
      <li>freezepeach.xyz</li>
      <li>rainbowdash.net</li>
      <li>social.heldscal.la</li>
      <li>unsafe.space</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We are willing to make exceptions for these rules for very small closed-registration instances as long as your users all respect our CoC when interacting with awoo.space users and are careful to respect whether or not folks are okay with you boosting their posts.</p>

<p>If all of this sounds reasonable to you, please sign up using <a href=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1R8j3NHNV7wof4KrG0s_f0RiCRn6cPz_2ROQmvcICFco/edit?usp=drive_web>this Google Form</a>.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact us if you want to discuss these terms or have any questions about federating with us.</p>
