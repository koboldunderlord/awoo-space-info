<p>The following guidelines are not a legal document, and final interpretation is up to the administration of Awoo.space; they are here to provide you with an insight into our content moderation policies:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    When interacting with other users, all users both local and remote are expected to adhere to the following:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Respect boundaries as placed by others</li>
      <li>Be respectful/apologize if someone tells you that you cross a boundary accidentally</li>
      <li>Give people space if you accidentally push past a boundary</li>
      <li>If you are on either side of this and are worried about the situation escalating, contact the admin or a mod</li>
      <li>Tag potentially upsetting content such as violence/blood, politics, nonconsentual actions, and other such topics</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    When interacting with other users, any users (local or remote) will be considered in the wrong in a conversation that goes sour if they participate in the following:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Microaggressions ("not all men", white/man/cis-splaining, using the wrong pronouns to address someone after being corrected, etc)</li>
      <li>Demanding education on problematic behavior from a non-admin/moderator</li>
      <li>Skirting the lines of being a troll</li>
      <li>Not tagging potentially sensitive replies</li>
      <li>Ableism, such as by calling out names regarding their mental capacity, pointing out behavior as mental illness as an insult, making fun of folks who experience learning disabilities or autism spectrum disorder, have language speaking deficiencies- whether by a condition or by not being a primary English speaker, and making light of any physical disabilities a person experiences</li>
    </ol>
    This is not an exhaustive list.  If any of these don't make sense or you would like a deeper explanation, please speak with an admin or moderator- we are more than happy to help you understand the problems with these kinds of behavior.
